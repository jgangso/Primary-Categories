WordPress plugin for setting and displaying primary categories for posts and custom post types.

== Description ==

WordPress plugin for setting and displaying primary categories for posts and custom post types*.

This plugin creates a meta box on the post edit screen titled "Primary Category" containing a drop down menu populated with all categories associated with that post**. Selecting a primary category and updating the post saves this data into a custom field with a meta key of "primary-category".

To display a list of all posts with a particular primary category, use the shortcode [primary-category name="cat_name"] where cat_name is the name of the primary category you wish to display. If a name is not specified, the shortcode will default to all posts with "uncategorized" set as the primary category.

*Note: Custom post types must support both categories and custom fields.

**Note: As new categories are added to a post, the post must be updated before those new categories will be available for selection as a primary category.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the 'primary-categories' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Select the primary category for each post via the post edit screen
4. Place shortcode to the content of any post type or access the data via the post meta key 'primary-category'

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= How can I access the primary category data? =

A post's primary category is stored in the post meta under the key 'primary-category'.

= What shortcode can I use to display posts with a particular primary category? =

[primary-category name=""]

*Note: Name should reference the primary category that is to be displayed, if no name is specified, the name parameter defaults to 'uncategorized'.

= Why isn't the category I added available as a primary category? =
